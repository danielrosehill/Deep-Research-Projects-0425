# Deep Research Projects

*A non-exhaustive collection of open-source implementations of deep research projects compiled on April 6, 2025.*

## What is Deep Research?

Deep research is a methodology that leverages chunking and iterative intelligent prompting to explore research questions thoroughly. It involves an AI-powered process that:

1. Breaks down complex questions into manageable sub-questions
2. Searches for relevant information across multiple sources
3. Synthesizes findings into comprehensive reports with citations
4. Iteratively refines its research direction based on discovered information

This is a fast-maturing and evolving network of open-source implementations inspired by features popularized by Google, OpenAI, and other major AI vendors. The projects listed below prioritize implementations that are relatively straightforward to use, typically requiring only an API key and minimal setup.
